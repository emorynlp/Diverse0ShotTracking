Welcome to Walkworth Inn! How can I assist you today?


Hi, I'd like to make a reservation for this upcoming Monday.


Of course! How many people will be in your party, and for how many nights would you like to book?


It's me, my wife, and 2 kids, and also my brother and his wife. We're staying for 5 days.


Thank you for providing that information. We have a few options:

    Room 243: This luxury suite offers one bed, but it might not be suitable for your entire party since it only accommodates two adults. However, it could be an option for one couple.

    Room 122: This room has two beds, which can comfortably accommodate up to four adults. However, it might not be sufficient for your entire party.

    Room 156: This room has one bed and is suitable for two adults, which could work for one couple.

To accommodate your party, I would suggest booking both Room 122 and Room 156. This combination would provide enough beds for all adults, with one couple sharing a bed in each room.

Would you like to proceed with this arrangement?

I don't think we need the luxury suite. What's the cheapest booking you can give us?

I understand. Let me calculate the most cost-effective option for your party.

For a group of six adults and two children, we could book:

    Room 122: This room has two beds and can accommodate up to four adults comfortably.
    Room 156: This room has one bed and can accommodate two adults.

This arrangement would provide a total of three beds, which should be sufficient for your party. We could also provide a rollaway bed or crib for the children if needed.

Let me calculate the total cost for the five-night stay using these rooms:

    Room 122: $150/night x 5 nights = $750
    Room 156: $213/night x 5 nights = $1065

The total cost for both rooms for the duration of your stay would be $1815.

Would you like to proceed with this booking?
